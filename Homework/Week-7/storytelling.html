		<h2>Storytelling</h2>
		<p>As is shown in the scatterplot, the gross domestic product (GDP) still proves to play a big part in the overall well-being of the EU member states. The highest levels of well-being can be found in northern and western EU member states while low levels are more common in eastern and southern member states, who are known to have suffered more from the economic crisis and/or have a weak economic situation.
		</p>
		<p>Along with this the GINI index shows an interesting yet complex overview of the income distribution among the European memberstates. As is shown in this visualisation, the GINI index does not always seem to go together with the same levels of GDP (and often matching low levels in wellbeing). While Bulgaria and Spain only differ 0.3% (2014) in their GINI index, the difference in GDP seems to be way bigger. With Bulgaria having a GDP which is almost a quarter of that of Spain, not all Spanish citizens seem to share in their countrys relative wealth.
		</p>
		<p>At the other end of the scale some Nordic and Eastern countries are seen to have equal GINI indexes, while Swedens GDP is almost triple of that of Slovakia and the average Swedish citizen seems to score almost one and a half point higher in terms of average wellbeing.
		</p>
		</br><h2>GINI Index</h2>
		<p>The Gini index is a statistical measure of distribution developed by the Italian statistician Corrado Gini in 1912. It is often used as a gauge of economic inequality, measuring income among a population. The index ranges from 0% to 100%, with 0% representing perfect equality and 100% representing perfect inequality.
		A country in which every resident has the same income would have an income Gini index of 0%. A country in which one resident earned all the income, while everyone else earned nothing, would have an income Gini index of 100%.

		</br><h2>Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</h2>
		<p>The gross domestic product (GDP) is one of the primary indicators used to gauge the health of a country's economy. It represents the total dollar value of all goods and services produced over a specific time period, often referred to as the size of the economy. Measuring GDP can be done in one of two ways: either by adding up what everyone earned in a year (income approach) or by adding up what everyone spent (expenditure method). Logically, both measures should arrive at roughly the same total. The income approach, which is sometimes referred to as GDP(I), is calculated by adding up total compensation to employees, gross profits for incorporated and nonincorporated firms, and taxes less any subsidies. The expenditure method is the more common approach and is calculated by adding total consumption, investment, government spending and net exports.
		As you can imagine, economic production and growth (which GDP represents) have a large impact on nearly everyone within that economy. For example, when the economy is healthy, you will typically see low unemployment and wage increases as businesses demand labor to meet the growing economy.

		</br><h2>Average Wellbeing</h2>
		<p>
		This measure of wellbeing is used as an indicator of how peoples lives are going overall. All of the populations were asked the following question:  Please imagine a ladder with steps numbered from zero at the bottom to 10 at the top. Suppose we say that the top of the ladder represents the best possible life for you; and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst possible life for you. On which step of the ladder do you feel you personally stand at the present time, assuming that the higher the step the better you feel about your life, and the lower the step the worse you feel about it? Which step comes closest to the way you feel?
