			<h3>Ratio between GDP and average wellbeing in EU</h3>
			<p>	
				The gross domestic product (GDP) still proves to play a big part in the overall well-being of the EU member states. The highest levels of well-being can be found in northern and western EU member states while low levels are more common in eastern and southern member states, who are known to have suffered more from the economic crisis and/or have a weak economic situation.
